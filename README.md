# WPF-Backlog

## What even is this so called Backlog?

This application is designed to help users keep track of their games. It aims to be simple and fast to use with an intuitive user interface. Users will be able to store their games into a MySQL database and get graphical presentation about their game completion rate. This application is written in C# using .NET framework and it is done as a part of Windows-Programming course at JAMK.

## Who would do such a thing?

I, Joel Kortelainen, am a 2nd year software engineering student at Jamk University of Applied Sciences.

## How do you even use the Backlog

Using the application is as simple as riding a tricycle. Start the application and click the button labeled 'Register'. Still with me?
Good! Now comes the hard part; you need to come up with a clever username and also a password but that's not all. You also need
to type in your email address. Once that has been taken care of you can log in using your newly created account and start adding
your games to the database. How great is that!?
